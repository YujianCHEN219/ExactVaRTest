# ExactVaRTest

Fast exact finite-sample back-testing for Value-at-Risk (VaR) models in R.

<!-- badges: start --><!-- badges: end -->

**ExactVaRTest** implements a forward dynamic programming algorithm that gives the exact finite-sample distributions and p-values of Christoffersen’s (1998) independence (IND) and conditional-coverage (CC) tests for Value-at-Risk (VaR) exception series. For completeness, it also provides the exact unconditional‑coverage (UC) test via a closed‑form binomial enumeration. 

In particular, it corrects the severe size distortions from which the usual asymptotic \(\chi^2\) approximation suffers in small samples and under extreme coverage rates.

* `backtest_lr()` returns the LR statistic, its exact p‑value, and a reject / fail‑to‑reject decision for one chosen test type (UC, IND, or CC).  

* `backtest_all()` runs the UC, IND, and CC tests jointly and returns summaries for all three statistics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ExactVaRTest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("YujianCHEN219/ExactVaRTest")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(ExactVaRTest)

set.seed(42)
x <- rbinom(300, 1, 0.03)          # synthetic 0/1 exception series

bt <- backtest_lr(x, alpha = 0.05, type = "cc")  # exact LR_cc back-test
print(bt)
```

## Main features

* Exact finite‑sample distributions and p‑values for LR\_ind and LR\_cc at any sample size *n*; for *n* ≤ 2000 the computation finishes in milliseconds to a few seconds.  

* C++ implementation via `Rcpp`, with automatic fallback to a pure‑R reference engine.  

* Minimal dependencies (`Rcpp`, `stats`); works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
